        <p>Hi, I am Xinjie Wang. I am the designer and developer of this website. And I am currently a student of
            master
            of computing in ANU. I really love coding, Fps games, and watching animations.
            Hope you love my website!
        </p>

        <hr />
        <p>In this website, I will introduce my favorite game <span><a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/"
                    target="_blank">Genshin Impact</a></span>. The reason why I
            chose this topic is that I really love this game not only the game itself but also the design and music
            of this game.
            And most importantly I can see that the game became better and better since it launched. This is the
            good time
            for me to build my own website to introduce it.
            Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed
            and published by miHoYo. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, iOS, and Android in 2020,
            and on PlayStation 5 in 2021, and is set for release on Nintendo Switch. The game features an
            anime-style open-world environment and an action-based battle system using elemental magic and
            character-switching. Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, which is home to seven
            nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god. The story follows
            the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling before becoming separated
            in Teyvat. The Traveler travels in search of the lost sibling with their companion Paimon and becomes
            involved in the affairs of Teyvat's nations.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this website, I will briefly introduce the game and the four main city of the game Including new maps
            just
            launched few weeks ago. And I will also make a video of the game to show you the Teyvat world. Hope you
            enjoy it.
        </p>
        <h1 id="reflection">About my site</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>This is the first time in my life to create and design a website. Looking back after completing it, there are
            many aspects that can be improved. At the same time, I made some mistakes during developing it, which led
            to a waste of time.</p>
        <p>First of all, as a beginner of web development, I did not reasonably design the content and page structures
            at the beginning of the semester after selecting the topic. At the beginning, I wanted to include
            too many things in my first website, which is unrealistic for a beginner. Next time, I think I
            will first design the framework of the whole web page. Another problem is that I started to write CSS codes
            for
            web pages before I had fully learned CSS. This also led me to encounter unsolvable bugs in the process of
            web page development, which also led me to delete all the css codes and start writing CSS from scratch
            again, which wasted a lot of time.
            Besides, another reason is that I did not add reasonable comments when writing code, which also causes me to
            spend a lot of time to understand the code I wrote before when adding comments later, which is very
            inefficient. And next time, I think I would validate my codes frequently as development goes through the
            validation tools,
            which I think is a good habit</p>
        <p>Lastly, I should learn Javascript earlier. Using Javascript may make my web page development more concise,
            just like I have repeated navigation bar code for every web page.</p>
