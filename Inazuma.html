      <div class="desc">Ritou:
        To properly explore the realm of the Shogun during this time of the Sakoku Decree, you must first pass the
        checkpoint in Ritou.
        Ritou is under the jurisdiction of the Kanjou Commission and people need various documents to be granted
        passage. However, to get the necessary Travel Permit, you have to go through a very complicated procedure and
        have the right connections.
        Without the Travel Permit, you can only stop briefly in Ritou. You will see other outlanders who are also stuck
        there, together looking out upon the desolate landscape of the fishing village with red maples and green roof
        tiles.

      <div class="desc">Inazuma City:
        Inazuma's most lively and prosperous area, where most of Inazuma's population lives. From Hanamizaka to the
        streets of the city, you can follow the trail to visit local traditional shops and sample Inazuma specialties.
        The Tenryou Commission is also located in the city, governing matters concerning public order and security, as
        well as the Shogunate's military affairs.
        At the top of Inazuma City is Tenshukaku, where the Raiden Shogun resides and rules over Inazuma.

      <div class="desc">Chinju Forest:
        A tranquil and mysterious forest located at the foot of Mt. Yougou.
        Here one can find Tanuki statues everywhere, torii gates scattered throughout the forest, and abandoned shrines
        hidden in the depths... Like a flowing river, they tell of legends meandering into a forgotten past.
        Rumor has it that when walking in Chinju Forest, you may encounter mysterious beings who like to play pranks...

      <div class="desc">Grand Narukami Shrine:
        The largest shrine in Inazuma, located at the peak of Mt. Yougou. It is dedicated to Her Excellency, the
        Almighty Narukami Ogosho.
        For those who have wishes, they can climb to the top of the mountain one step at a time. For those who have
        gained the favor of Electro, they can use the Thunder Spheres to fly up and reach the shrine surrounded by the
        huge Sacred Sakura Tree. The Sacred Sakura is in constant bloom, symbolizing the eternity of Narukami.
        After passing through the many torii gates, find the shrine maiden to draw a fortune slip and ask for Narukami's
        blessing.</div>

      <div class="desc">Tatarasuna, Kannazuka:
        Legend has it that Kannazuka means "the hill where no gods reside." Until now, Kannazuka is disputed territory
        between the Shogunate and Sangonomiya.
        Kannazuka has a mountainous terrain with high steep cliffs. In the midst of the rocky outcrops lies Mikage
        Furnace, the largest smelting facility in Inazuma. This is where Jade Steel is made, a rare material that is
        used in Inazuma to forge swords.</div>

      <div class="desc">Serpent's Head:
        Of the giant serpent that was defeated by the Electro Archon with the Musou no Hitotachi, only its
        weather-bleached remains are left today. Although its skull still looks up at the sky defiantly, the god is
        already dead, and so the name of "Watatsumi Omikami" is gradually being forgotten.
        Even if the giant serpent is long dead, you can still clearly feel the traces of its power left behind. Under
        the influence of the Tatarigami, Yashiori Island has been deserted by its inhabitants. What can be seen on the
        island are just endless rain and thunderstorms trying to wash away the remnants of the past.</div>
